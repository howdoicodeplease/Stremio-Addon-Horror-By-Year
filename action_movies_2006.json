Throughout the European Theater of Operations, Lieutenant John Schmidt comes face to face with these weapons. The Office of Strategic Services (O.S.S., precursor to the C.I.A.) initiates missions behind enemy lines to find the source of the weapons terrorizing U.S. soldiers fighting the Third Reich. Schmidt is joined by Captain Joe Russo and his group of war-hardened GIs who have experienced for themselves the all-too-real horrors of war. Together, they must find and destroy Hitler's horde of nightmare weapons before his horrific vision can be fully realized.",

The movie shows the confusion shown by the mob and the police over Yip's sudden philanthropy as he makes headline after headline for doing good deeds, not bad. This does not sit well with his old triad boss Brother Hung (Ti Lung) nor Hung's son, Gwai Chai (Stephen Fung). Gwai Chai in particular is itching to rise the ranks of the mob and take over and sets up deals on his own which increasingly puts pressure on himself to deliver. The mob's success hinges on Yip's connections to Thailand and Gwai Chai takes matters to the extreme in order to force his deal to be a success, leading to a suspenseful conclusion back in Thailand.",
