    "description": "After participating in the opening ceremony, Conan, Professor Agasa, Ran, Haibara, and the Detective Boys are enjoying the view from the observation deck of the 635-metre tall Bell Tree Tower. Suddenly, a bullet breaks through a window, strikes a man's chest and breaks a TV screen, causing everyone to panic. Conan stays calm and, using the zoom function on his tracking glasses to follow the path of the bullet to its source, spots the sniper. He and Masumi Sera, who had been present at the Tower as part of an assignment to shadow the victim, pursue the fleeing culprit on Masumi's motorcycle, but the chase takes a violent turn when the suspect uses a handgun and even hand grenades to take out his pursuers. Even the FBI get involved in the chase, but the culprit and the mysteries of the sniping end up vanishing into the ocean.\n\nThe investigation turns up a connection to the special United States Navy squadron, the Navy SEALS and other former US military officers working in Japan. However, the first sniping was just the beginning; as more people are shot, the citizens of Tokyo panic! What is the meaning of the rifle case and dice left behind? As his investigation progresses, Conan soon finds himself in the sniper's cross-hairs, only to be saved by Masumi who intervenes and takes the bullet in his stead. And, in the background, Subaru Okiya begins to make his move...\n\nThe sniper/culprit is Kevin Yoshino, while the entire murder plan was created by his master Timothy Hunter. Kevin became Hunter's student and helped him carry out the plan because he wanted to repay Hunter for saving his life during their war operations in the Middle East.\n\nThe reason for the serial killings was that Waltz was jealous of Hunter's achievements, which belittled his own actions. Waltz set Hunter up so he wouldn't get the Silver Star. He even ordered Murphy to assassinate Hunter, but the bullet failed to kill him, although a fragment of it remained in Hunter's skull and damaged his optical nerves, severely impairing him. Yoshino eventually discovered the deception, but Waltz destroyed the evidence before it could be used in court, driving Hunter into conceiving his revenge plan. The five sniping positions used for the murders, if viewed from ground level, combine to form a pentagon, which marks the five points of a Silver Star.\n\nKevin attempted to kill Waltz, but Conan saved the latter by kicking a ball at him to knock him out of the bullet's way. Kevin then attempted to kill Conan, but Subaru saved him. Ran, unaware of Conan's plan of saving Ayumi decides to go after Kevin herself but trips ends up being Kevin's target. She is saved thanks to the combined effort of Conan and Subaru, and she manages to take Kevin down after that - for Ayumi, for Sonoko and for Sera. In the end, Subaru Okiya answers a call from James Black with Shuichi Akai's voice.",

Within the four decades of guarding Hong Kong's financial integrity, the ICAC has never come across an opponent so huge and so well organized as in the Z Torrent file... shadowy figures from the underworld of South America, Italy and Europe all ready to plot against the estimated 150 million dollars of Hong Kong citizens' tax money which was pooled in a fund called the WELFARE FUND. High profile chartered accountants, high ranking law enforcers, power lawyers, the super entrepreneurs; they all have their shares of play but none can really grasp the big picture; they are there only for what they desire most. When the wife of an up-rising star Superintendent of police force reported his corruption simply out of bitterness for being ill-treated, little did she know she is about to pull the head string from a very well weaved web of deceive, greed, sex, power, and last but not least, fear. The ICAC agent LOK who took charge of the simple complaint felt otherwise... it's his passion for justice that has been driving him all these years in the battle against bribery and corruption, even after losing his beloved wife. Further investigation soon revealed many unanswered questions and loose ends...the death of an ex-godfather status accountant of Hong Kong, the threats to even the seemingly harmless witnesses and informers, and the surfacing of a mysterious lady that has all connection with LOK's wanted list but with a background as simple and as tragic as a girl next door with terminal illness... As Lok dug deeper into the web, he is being hunted by trained foreign mercenaries; a tactic very seldom or never heard of in the history of Hong Kong's underworld! With the support of his superior the old but streetwise Deputy Chief of ICAC, Lok eventually unlocked the door to the plan, but only after a bloodbath gun battle that almost cost him his life and that of the attractive mysterious woman, Angel.",

    "description": "Macedonia is a small country, in the heart of the Balkans, which for five centuries was under the yoke of the Ottoman Empire. The action of the film \"To the Hilt\" takes place in the years of the general collapse and \"free fall\", after the Macedonian uprising of 1903 which was extinguished in blood. The story is a love quadrangle between an uncompromising idealist rebel, a merciless Turkish officer, an opportunist rich man's son returning home after his studies in Europe and a lucid and open minded European woman, who flirts with the three men and puts in train a series of events with dire consequences, that she could hardly imagine. The characters go through turbulent collisions which lead them to cathartic experiences and new self-awareness. The film is a harsh and romantic story in which the eternal Macedonian cause for own identity and independence is seen through the prism of relativity of the ideas of freedom, justice, love, sacrifice, and treason. The story dramatizes and parodies the myth and anti-myth of East and West, of Europe and the Balkans. It leads to a boiling point the paradoxes and absurdities of Macedonian history.",
