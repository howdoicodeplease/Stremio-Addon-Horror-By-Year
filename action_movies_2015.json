However, the others in the gang view Kageyama with disdain and ridicule him for his inability to get tattooed due to sensitive skin. One day, assassins aware of boss Kamiura's secret arrive from abroad and deliver him an ultimatum: Return to the international syndicate he left years ago, or die. Kamiura refuses and, during a fierce battle with anime-otaku martial-arts expert Kyoken, is torn limb from limb. With his dying breath, Kamiura bites Kageyama, passing on his vampire powers to the unsuspecting yakuza. As he begins to awaken to his newfound abilities, Kageyama's desire to avenge the murder of boss Kamiura sets him on a course for a violent confrontation with Kaeru-kun, the foreign syndicate's mysterious and seemingly unstoppable leader!",

At the upcoming outdoor company event, he is finally able to give the three distinguished egomanians a lesson in \"High Performance\". But team optimization in the Hochseilgarten was yesterday. PR manager Vanessa Kramer (Lavinia Wilson) wants to land a press coup and is based on unusual methods: she lets a perfect hostage take place - however, from detached actors. For the two spaghetti Western actors, nothing is closer than to improve their salary with real ransom and real weapons. While Vanessa is doing everything to cover up the breakdown in front of her boss (Hanns Zischler) and the media representatives present, the inexperienced hostesses have to deal with quite different problems: how to make it clear to the successful managers that they are no longer in an ingenious Rolling game?",

    "description": "Steeped in wonder and mystery, HISZPANKA (Influenz) tells the story of a group of clairvoyants committed to restoring the Polish state as World War One dwindles to an end. Gathered inside a hotel room for a special séance, the magi use their power to save Jan Paderewski, the legendary pianist and symbolic leader of a successful patriotic uprising. At the same time, a hostile medium hired by the Prussian army is trying to influence Paderewski with his negative power. The eerily whirring table becomes the center of an unfolding melodrama, giving birth to a love requiring the highest sacrifice of all.   At once a pitch-black comedy of bourgeois manners, an alternative version of history and an unconventional spy thriller, ukasz Barczyks HISZPANKA (Influenz) creates a parallel world all its own. The movie merges fiction with historical fact, telling the true story of the only successful uprising in Polish history, which took place in Greater Poland in the years 1918-19. Visually ravishing, the film takes place in the digitally recreated city of Pozna at the turn of the 20th century. The look of HISZPANKA is a nod to the works of German Expressionism, with the central figure of Dr Abuse being an obvious heir to Fritz Langs Dr Mabuse. Besides being a playful meditation on the nature of cinema itself, Influence provides a deep reflection of the eternal power struggle between reason and affect, order and chaos, as well as matter and spirit.",
