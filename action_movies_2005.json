While on a ski trip, one of them finds passion with a beautiful girl after a random accident on the icy slopes. The others quickly conclude that the extreme circumstances of the accident were what caused love to bloom. They decide that the path to true love is to purposely set each other up on \"extreme dates\" with the objects of their affections. After a couple of near-successes, they go for broke by planning an elaborate kidnapping scheme that can't miss. But the hired \"kidnappers\" turn out to be ex-cons with a plan of their own, and the extreme date escalates out of control. The remaining friends must now rescue the captives, while desperately trying to avoid the long arm of the law. Obstacles pop up left and right, as the adventure gets wilder and wilder. The pursuit eventually takes us back to L.A., where secrets begin to get exposed.... In the end, will extreme dating lead to true love?",
